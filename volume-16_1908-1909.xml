                         <persName ref="#Andrews_Emma_B">Emma B. Andrews</persName> is best remembered
                         for her association with the millionaire lawyer turned archaeologist/art and
                         antiquities collector, <persName ref="#Davis_Theodore">Theodore M.

                         archaeology and pioneering Egyptologists of the time. She paints a revealing
                         picture of the lives of the colonial gentry and the cultural and scientific
                         literati in <placeName ref="#Egypt">Egypt</placeName> at the dawn of the
                         twentieth century. To date, her diaries are unpublished; analysis of the
                         contents of 19 volumes will afford scholars and a general audience information
                         about an important historical resource for the first time. Since its inception
                         in 2010, the scope of our project has broadened to include the transcription and
                         digitization of a wide range of primary historical material from the 'Golden
                         Age' of Egyptian archaeology detailed in the Research section of this website.
                         The Emma B. Andrews Diary Project is one of the founding partners of Newbook

<p><title>Thursday. Nov. 5th 1908. SS. Princess Irene. </title></p>

    <p>We are nearing the end of this part of our voyage – having sailed
    from <placeName ref="#New_York">New York</placeName> Saturday the 24th Oct.  <persName  ref="#Newberry_Mary">Mary Newberry</persName> who had been
    spending the week there, and <persName ref="#Ohio_Anita">Anita Ohio</persName> went down to see us off. 
    <persName ref="#Jennings_Walter_Mr_Mrs">Mrs. And Mr. Walter Jennings</persName> and family – 2 children, 2 maids, tutor
    and governess, with <persName ref="#Gallandet_Miss">Miss Gallandet</persName>, and sister <persName ref="#Jennings_Miss">Miss Jennings</persName>, were
    fellow passengers. They are relatives of <persName ref="#Amkincloss_Hugh">Mrs. Hugh Amkincloss</persName>, who
    was <persName ref="#Jennings_Miss">Miss Jennings</persName>.  <persName ref="#Pell_Herbert_Mr_Mrs">Mr. and Mrs. Herbert Pell</persName>, also on board.  A
    dull voyage, much rain and warm – I occupied for the 3rd time the
    Captain’s charming rooms on the bridge – and what lovely hours of
    rest and quiet I had, after all the din and stir of the summer.  The
    steamer is comfortable but slow, we reached <placeName ref= "#Gibraltar">Gibraltar</placeName> on the 11th
    day and ought to be in <placeName ref="#Naples">Naples</placeName> tonight, only we won’t, at least we
    hope to make our steamer tomorrow. </p>

<p>We did just make our steamer the
‘Preussen’ on Friday – <persName ref="#Pell_Mr_Mrs">Mr. and Mrs. Pell</persName> with us.  We all occupied the
Captain’s and officer’s rooms on the bridge – and were very comfortable
– landed at <placeName ref="#Alexandria">Alexandria</placeName> at 3 this P.M. got the train, and at 7 o’clock
were installed in our familiar rooms on the pleasant garden.  We have
never been so early before. Not many people yet.</p>

<p><persName ref="#Eldon_Sir">Eldon</persName> and <persName ref="#Gorst_Lady">Lady Gorst</persName>. <persName ref="#Pell_Mr_Mrs">Mr. and Mrs. Pell</persName> have been dining with us. We
have had a busy 10 days in <placeName ref="#Cairo">Cairo</placeName>.  Every one has been so kind.  We went
to <persName ref="#Gorst_Lady">Lady Gorsts</persName> to a garden party – to the <persName ref="#Iddings_Mr_Mrs">Iddings</persName> to dine – and to a
tea, where we met delightful people.  <persName ref="#Iddings_Mr_Mrs">Mr. and Mrs. Iddings</persName> dined with us
that evening, and <persName ref="#Trefusis_Capt">Capt. Trefusis</persName> – <persName ref="#Maspero">M. Maspero</persName> another evening, and the
Capt. Who also lunched with us.  The great event was <persName ref="Davis_Theodore">Theo’s</persName> presentation
to the Khedive, which <persName ref="#Iddings_Mr">Mr Iddings</persName> has been trying to persuade him to do
for 3 years – but this year he consented – and he was received in a
private audience.  <persName ref="#Iddings_Mr">Mr. Iddings</persName> came for him in his own carriage, with
his decorative Kavass, and 2 gorgeous running Sayces, and <persName ref="Davis_Theodore">Theo</persName> had to
appear in frock coat and top hat at 10 in the morning.  I couldn’t but
laugh when I saw them drive off in such style, for I knew how he hated
it.  It was very successful however, and <persName ref="#Iddings_Mr">Mr. Iddings</persName> told me he had
     never seen the Khedive so interested in an interview.</p>

     <p>In town with <persName ref="#Davis_Theodore">Theo</persName> this morning, doing last things. <persName ref="#Trefusis_Capt">Capt. Trefusis</persName>
     lunched with us.  Our tug took us to the bridge landing at 1
     o’clock and we hoped to get through the draw comfortably.  But the
     usual scrimmage occurred – and we came near losing the top of our
     big boom.  Then we had to get through the new <placeName ref="Giza">Ghizeh</placeName> bridge – we
     landed the Capt. And waited until most of the gyassas had passed
     through.  We got as far as the big Sugar station, 5 miles below
     <placeName ref="Bedreschein">Bedreschein</placeName> – very cold.</p>

<p><title>Saturday. Nov. 28. 32 miles. </title></p>

<p>A very early start, before dawn.  Such a
beautiful hour followed! The sunrise, and this strange, interesting
land, and the quiet hour of reading and reflection, nothing can ever
take it from me.  A fine day, with strong N.W. wind, which meeting the
strong current of the river, made quite a sea.  We reached <placeName ref="#Nagh_Hamadi">Nagh Hamadi</placeName>
at 3 o’clock thinking the bridge opened at 3:30 but found it opened at 3
o’clock – so we were forced to stay the night.  It was quiet enough –
and the late afternoon and evening most lovely.</p>

<p><title>First Sunday in Advent. Nov. 29.</title></p>

     <p>We passed the bridge most easily at 7:30 – before I got up.  The
     tug took us up as far as the difficult turn at <placeName ref="#Kasr_es_Sayd">Kasr es Sayd</placeName> – then
     left us with much hearty leave-takings and receiving of liberal
     backsheesh.  The day was absolutely calm, and we were left alone in
     the middle of the river, with both sails limply hanging – we have
     tracked, pulled to the anchor and sailed a little very quietly and
     are now lying

     <p>Made an early start this morning in a good wind, and reached this
     high bank, one mile below <placeName ref="#Naqada">Nagada</placeName> at 5.30.  An exciting day – the
     boat careering madly along – sailors shouting – sails changing, and
     all the clamor of a sharp sailing.  The morning was delicious – I
     was on deck all the time until we were delayed by a gyassa which
     cut across our bow in an awkward way, and going immediately upon
     the sand just in front of us, we had to pull up so sharply that we
     went with a  great thump on the bank – there was a great tumbling
     about of all movable things – and when I came below to see about it
     - I found <persName ref="Amelie">Amelie</persName>, <persName ref="#Jones_Daniel">Jones</persName>, <persName ref="#Hassein">Hassein</persName>, and <persName ref="#Hassoun">Hassoun</persName> busy setting

     gallantly in with sails filled at 5.30 and found ourselves the
     first arrival of the season. Everyone was on the lookout for us,
     and we were told that we made a splendid appearance, as we rushed
     along past the town to our old mooring ground on the island. 
     <persName ref="#Jones_Harold">Harold Jones</persName> was waiting for us at the Winter Palace, Tuesday being

     <p>A quiet day at home – <persName ref="#Davis_Theodore">Theo</persName> and <persName ref="#Knagenbjelm_Eleanor">Eleanor</persName> over at the Valley. The
     roads and embankments have been so spoiled by the river, that they
     are well nigh impossible – and I cannot get over in my chair until
     they

are better. Last night about 12 o’clock, I was aroused by cries that I
thought must be those of a jackal – it proved to have been a man in the
river.  Six men had gone to our opposite neighbor <persName ref="#Insinger_Mr">Mr. Insingers</persName>, to rob
and steal.  They overpowered the night watchman, and one of them got
into the house.  <persName ref="#Insinger_Mr">Mr. Insinger</persName> sent a shot at the man, who ran, followed
by <persName ref="#Insinger_Mr">Mr. Insinger</persName> firing at him – the man took to the river, and found the
current so strong that he screamed for help.  The police appeared and
caught the man, who gave the names of the men with him.  There is a
great deal of lawlessness about the country and some alarm felt.</p>

<p>hear of poor <persName ref="#Smith_Corinna">Corinna’s</persName> disaster.  She was here yesterday morning as

one eye – which grew so bad that she became delirious.  They (she and
<persName ref="#Smith_Joseph_Lindon">Joe</persName>) got some donkeys and came at a walk all the way to the river, where
they quietly aroused some of our sailors, who rowed them across to Luxor
to the doctor.  He advised them to go at once to Cairo – and they now
are on their way there.  It is a hideous experience for the poor things
– a very bad case of opthalmia.  The <persName ref="#Brown_Walter">Walter Browns</persName> here to tea. </p>
